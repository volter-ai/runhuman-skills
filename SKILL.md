# Runhuman CLI

Runhuman connects AI coding tools to on-demand professional human testers. You describe what to test in natural language, a real human performs the test, and you get structured feedback back.

## When to Use Runhuman

**Good for:** User flows (signup, checkout), visual/layout testing, mobile responsiveness, UX feedback, exploratory testing, cross-browser checks.

**Not for:** Unit tests, performance benchmarks, security audits, or high-frequency automated test suites.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (or use npx runhuman for any command without installing)
npm install -g runhuman

# 2. Authenticate (opens browser for GitHub OAuth)
runhuman login

# 3. Set up a project
#    List existing projects:
runhuman projects list
#    Or create a new one:
runhuman projects create "My App" --organization <orgId> --default-url https://staging.myapp.com --set-default
#    Switch to an existing project:
runhuman projects switch <projectId>

# 4. Create a test
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test the signup flow: click Sign Up, fill the form, verify confirmation page"
```

**Deciding between new vs existing project:** Ask the user whether they want to create a new project or use an existing one. Use `runhuman projects list` to show what exists, then either `projects create` with `--set-default` or `projects switch` to set the active project. `projects switch` sets the default globally (in `~/.config/runhuman/config.json`) by default; pass `--global false` to set it locally for the current directory only.

**Setting defaults:** Use `runhuman config set <key> <value>` to set defaults like `project`, `color`, or `apiUrl`. Use `runhuman config list` to see the full configuration hierarchy.

**Local repo config:** Run `runhuman init` to create a `.runhumanrc` in the current directory with project name, default duration/device class, and one-or-more linked GitHub repos. Pass `--yes` to skip prompts, or `--name`, `--github-repo <owner/repo>`, or `--github-repos <a/b,c/d>` to fill values non-interactively.

## Job Command Namespace

All job commands live under `runhuman job`:

```bash
runhuman job create   # create a new test
runhuman job status   # check a job's status
runhuman job wait     # block until a job completes
runhuman job results  # view detailed results
runhuman job list     # list jobs (with filters)
runhuman job watch    # tail a live job
runhuman job artifact # download a raw session artifact
runhuman job share    # toggle public sharing on
runhuman job unshare  # toggle public sharing off
runhuman job create-issue  # file an extracted finding as a GitHub issue
```

> **Deprecated flat shims.** The older flat forms (`runhuman create`, `runhuman status`, `runhuman wait`, `runhuman results`, `runhuman list`, `runhuman watch`) still resolve but emit a one-line deprecation warning and are scheduled for removal. **Always emit `runhuman job <subcommand>` in new scripts** — don't introduce flat-shim invocations.

### Truncated IDs

All commands accept truncated ID prefixes, similar to git short hashes. The CLI resolves the best match automatically:

```bash
runhuman job status 712e          # resolves to full job ID
runhuman projects switch proj     # resolves to matching project
```

If multiple IDs match, the CLI asks for more characters. Destructive operations (`projects delete`, `keys delete`, `projects transfer --to-org`) require full IDs.

### Wait for Results

```bash
# Block until the test completes (useful in CI/CD)
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test checkout flow end-to-end" \
  --sync

# Check status of an existing job
runhuman job status <jobId>

# Wait for a previously-created job to finish
runhuman job wait <jobId>

# View detailed results
runhuman job results <jobId>
```

## Creating Tests

The `job create` command is the primary way to submit tests. At minimum, provide a URL and either a description or a template.

### With a Description

```bash
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test the signup flow: click Sign Up, fill the form, verify confirmation page"
```

### With an Output Schema

Use `--schema` or `--schema-inline` to get structured JSON results back:

```bash
# Schema from a file
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test the search feature" \
  --schema ./search-schema.json \
  --sync --json

# Inline schema
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test signup and login" \
  --schema-inline '{"signupWorks":{"type":"boolean"},"loginWorks":{"type":"boolean"},"issues":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}}' \
  --sync --json
```

Example schema file (`search-schema.json`):
```json
{
  "searchWorks": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "description": "Does the search return results?"
  },
  "resultCount": {
    "type": "number",
    "description": "Number of results shown"
  },
  "issues": {
    "type": "array",
    "description": "List of any bugs or issues found"
  }
}
```

When a job completes with a schema, `runhuman job results <jobId> --json` returns the extracted data inside the standard envelope at `data.result.data`:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "jobId": "job_abc123",
    "status": "completed",
    "result": {
      "passed": true,
      "explanation": "All tests passed successfully",
      "data": {
        "searchWorks": true,
        "resultCount": 10,
        "issues": []
      }
    },
    "costUsd": 0.18,
    "testDurationSeconds": 120
  }
}
```

Use `--schema-only` to get just the extracted schema data: `runhuman job results <jobId> --schema-only`.

### With a Template

Templates are reusable test configurations. Use `--template` to reference one by name or `--template-file` to point to a local `.md` file:

```bash
# By name (resolved from repo .runhuman/templates/ → project templates → built-ins)
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com --template "Find Bugs"

# By local file path
runhuman job create --template-file .runhuman/templates/smoke-test.md
```

When using a template, URL and description are optional — they can come from the template itself.

### Device Class

Specify `--device-class desktop` or `--device-class mobile` to control what device the tester uses:

```bash
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com -d "Test mobile layout" --device-class mobile
```

### Tester Pool Requirements

Filter which testers are eligible for the job. **Max / Enterprise / Enterprise Pro plans only** — on lower plans, the server rejects job creation with an upgrade link. Do not add these flags unless the user has said they're on a qualifying plan or explicitly asked for pool filtering.

| Flag | Values | Match |
|------|--------|-------|
| `--required-devices` | comma-separated: `ios`, `android`, `pc`, `mac` | any — tester needs at least one |
| `--required-languages` | comma-separated: `english`, `spanish` | all — tester must speak every one |
| `--require-social-videos` | boolean | — |
| `--require-apk-install` | boolean | — |

So `--required-languages english,spanish` requires a bilingual tester, not either/or.

```bash
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test the checkout flow on Android" \
  --required-devices android
```

### Multi-Repo Context

A job can be linked to one or more GitHub repos so AI-extracted findings can be filed back as issues. Provide repos in any of three ways:

```bash
# Single repo (back-compat flag)
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com -d "Test checkout" \
  --github-repo owner/repo

# Multiple repos, comma-separated
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com -d "Test checkout" \
  --github-repos "owner/frontend,owner/backend"

# Or inherit from the project / template / .runhumanrc default
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com -d "Test checkout"
```

Add `--auto-create-github-issues` to have the server file each AI-extracted finding as a GitHub issue automatically once the job completes. Requires at least one linked repo (via the flags above, the template, or the project default).

### Async Workflow (Create, Wait, Get Results)

If you don't use `--sync`, create the job first, then wait for it separately:

```bash
# 1. Create the job (returns immediately)
JOB_ID=$(runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com -d "Test search" --json | jq -r '.data.jobId')

# 2. Wait for the tester to complete (blocks with live status updates)
runhuman job wait "$JOB_ID"

# 3. Get the results
runhuman job results "$JOB_ID" --json
```

`job wait` accepts `--timeout <seconds>` (default: 600). Use `--json` on any command when you need structured output for scripting or automation. JSON responses use a stable envelope — list payloads sit at `data.items`, single-entity payloads sit at `data` directly.

## Templates

Templates define what to test, how long to test, and what results to collect. There are three sources, checked in this order:

| Source | Location | How to create |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Repo templates** | `.runhuman/templates/*.md` in the user's repo | Commit markdown files |
| **Project templates** | Stored in Runhuman database | `templates create` or dashboard |
| **Built-in templates** | Bundled with Runhuman | Available automatically |

### Built-in Templates

Three built-in templates cover common QA scenarios:

| Template | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **Find Bugs** | Test the app and report bugs with severity, steps to reproduce, expected behavior |
| **Assess UX** | Evaluate usability, visual design, mobile-friendliness, and rate 1-10 |
| **Give Product Feedback** | Provide honest feedback: first impressions, strengths, weaknesses, suggestions |

### Repo Templates

Repo templates are `.md` files in `.runhuman/templates/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Smoke Test
duration: 5
device_class: desktop
url: https://staging.example.com
---

Verify the app loads and core features work:

1. Load the homepage and confirm it renders without errors
2. Navigate to the login page and verify the form appears
3. Check that the main navigation links work

## Results

Page loads without errors: [ ]
Login form is accessible: [ ]
Navigation works: [ ]
Issues found: ___
```

Frontmatter fields (all optional): `name`, `duration` (minutes, 1-60), `device_class` (`desktop`/`mobile`), `url`, `max_extension_minutes`, `extension_count`, `github_repos` (YAML list of `owner/repo` strings).

### Creating Project Templates via CLI

```bash
runhuman templates create "Search Test" \
  --project proj_abc123 \
  -d "Search for 'recursion' and confirm the joke appears" \
  --schema ./search-test-schema.json
```

Options: `--duration <minutes>` (1-60), `--device-class <class>`, `--schema <path>`.

List templates: `runhuman templates list --project <projectId>`

## Job Output: Results, Artifacts, Sharing, Issues

`job results` is the high-level view. For raw access or follow-on actions, four other sub-commands are available:

```bash
# High-level results view (with optional rich-data flags)
runhuman job results <jobId>
runhuman job results <jobId> --transcript --console-logs
runhuman job results <jobId> --all          # every rich section
runhuman job results <jobId> --schema-only  # just extracted schema data
runhuman job results <jobId> --raw          # raw tester response

# Download a single raw artifact (good for piping)
runhuman job artifact <jobId> transcript
runhuman job artifact <jobId> console-logs --json | jq '.data.consoleMessages[]'
# Other types: structured-output, network-requests, conversation, events, key-moments

# Toggle public sharing — `share` prints the public URL
runhuman job share <jobId>
runhuman job unshare <jobId>

# File one extracted finding as a GitHub issue
runhuman job create-issue <jobId> --index 0
runhuman job create-issue <jobId> --index 0 --repo owner/repo  # override default
```

Rich-data sections (transcript, logs, network, events, key-moments, conversation) and the corresponding `job artifact` types are paid-tier gated server-side. Ungated requests return a clean "subscription required" error.

`job create-issue` mirrors the dashboard's per-finding "Create Issue" button — it submits the finding unedited. Use the dashboard or `gh issue edit` if you want to tweak title/body afterwards.

## Projects

```bash
runhuman projects list
runhuman projects create "My App" --organization <orgId> [--default-url <url>] [--github-repo <owner/repo>] [--github-repos <a/b,c/d>] [--set-default]
runhuman projects show <projectId>
runhuman projects update <projectId> [--name <text>] [--default-url <url>] [--github-repo <owner/repo>] [--github-repos <a/b,c/d>]
runhuman projects switch <projectId>            # `--global false` for current dir only
runhuman projects transfer <projectId> --to-org <orgId>   # full IDs required
runhuman projects delete <projectId> --force    # full ID required
```

`--github-repo` accepts a single `owner/repo`; `--github-repos` accepts a comma-separated list and replaces (rather than appends to) the project's repo set.

## Organizations

```bash
runhuman orgs list
runhuman orgs show <orgId>
runhuman orgs balance <orgId>
runhuman orgs projects <orgId>
runhuman orgs switch <orgId>                # `--global` (default) or local

# Membership
runhuman orgs members <orgId>
runhuman orgs invite <orgId> <email> --role <admin|contributor|viewer>
runhuman orgs remove <orgId> <userId>

# Pending invitations
runhuman orgs invitations list --organization <orgId>
runhuman orgs invitations revoke <invitationId> --organization <orgId> --yes

# Usage analytics
runhuman orgs usage                          # current org, last 30 days
runhuman orgs usage --period 7d              # 7d | 30d | 90d | all
runhuman orgs usage --year 2026 --month 4    # specific month (year+month)
runhuman orgs usage --json                   # full response, incl. overTime / byHour / bySource
```

`orgs invite` defaults to `--role contributor`. Default-org context is used by `invitations list/revoke` and `usage` when `--organization` is omitted.

## Billing

User-scoped reads. Purchase flows and plan changes stay in the web UI — use `billing portal` to get there.

```bash
runhuman billing balance                # credit balance for primary org (or --organization)
runhuman billing subscription           # current tier, period, add-ons
runhuman billing portal                 # one-time URL to the Polar customer portal
runhuman billing portal --open          # open it in the default browser
```

## Tester Notes (paid feature)

Notes are a knowledge-base entries shown to testers as additional context. **Requires an active organization subscription** — calls fail cleanly with a subscription-required error otherwise.

```bash
runhuman notes list                          # everything visible to you
runhuman notes list --search "checkout" --tags "context,gotcha"
runhuman notes show <noteId>
runhuman notes create "Auth context" -b "Use the demo account..." --tags "context"
runhuman notes create "Auth context" --body-file ./note.md --project <projectId>
runhuman notes update <noteId> [--title <t>] [--body <text> | --body-file <path>] [--tags <list>] [--public|--internal]
runhuman notes delete <noteId>               # full ID required
```

Notes default to internal-only; pass `--public` on `create`/`update` to make them customer-visible. Scope is org by default, or pass `--project` to scope to a single project.

## GitHub Integration

```bash
runhuman github link <owner/repo> --project <projectId>
runhuman github repos --organization <orgId> [--search <query>]
runhuman github issues <owner/repo> [--state open|closed|all] [--labels "bug,needs-qa"]
runhuman github test <issueNumber> -r <owner/repo> -u <url> [--template <id>] [--sync]
runhuman github bulk-test -r <owner/repo> -u <url> [--labels <list>] [--state <state>] [--limit <n>]

# Force-refresh a GitHub App installation's repo/permissions list — use after granting
# the app access to new repos if they don't show up in `github repos` yet.
runhuman github installation refresh --installation <installationId> --organization <orgId>
```

## Schedules and Transfers

```bash
# Recurring scheduled jobs (cron-style)
runhuman schedules list
runhuman schedules create / show / update / delete   # see --help for each

# Project transfers (accept/reject/cancel a transfer to/from another org)
runhuman transfers list
runhuman transfers accept <transferId>
runhuman transfers reject <transferId>
runhuman transfers cancel <transferId>
```

Run `runhuman schedules --help` and `runhuman transfers --help` for full surfaces.

## Auth, Init, Config

```bash
# Auth
runhuman login                    # browser OAuth
runhuman login --token <apiKey>   # non-interactive
runhuman logout
runhuman whoami

# Initialize a local .runhumanrc
runhuman init
runhuman init --name "My App" --github-repos "owner/frontend,owner/backend" --yes

# Config
runhuman config get <key>
runhuman config set <key> <value> [--global]
runhuman config list [--show-secrets]
runhuman config reset --project|--global|--all --force
```

Config priority: CLI flags > env vars (`RUNHUMAN_API_KEY`, `RUNHUMAN_API_URL`, `RUNHUMAN_PROJECT_ID`, `RUNHUMAN_NO_COLOR`) > `.runhumanrc` (project) > `~/.config/runhuman/config.json` (global) > defaults.

## Writing Effective Test Descriptions

The `-d` / `--description` flag is the most important part of a test. Be specific.

**Good:**
```
Test the checkout process:
1. Add a product to cart
2. Click "Checkout"
3. Fill shipping address
4. Complete purchase
Report: bugs, UX confusions, mobile layout issues
```

**Bad:**
```
Test the site
```

Tips:
- Include exact steps or flows to follow
- Specify what pages and buttons to interact with
- State what to look for (bugs, UX issues, visual problems)
- For mobile testing, mention that explicitly in the description

When the project has a repo connected, extracted issues come back grounded in real code paths (e.g. `apps/web/src/checkout/CartButton.tsx:123`) rather than abstract descriptions — you can act on them directly without first hunting down the relevant file. See the [Code Context docs](https://runhuman.com/docs/code-context).

## CI/CD Integration

> **When users ask about CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or automating QA in their pipeline:** Fetch the comprehensive agent guide at `https://runhuman.com/for_agents_github_actions.md` and follow its instructions to walk the user through setup. The guide covers PR-triggered testing, scheduled exploratory QA, on-demand testing, label management, and platform-specific examples (Vercel, Netlify, Fly.io, Railway).

> **Determining the latest action version:** Before writing any workflow file, check the latest release of the GitHub Action by running `gh release list --repo volter-ai/runhuman-action --limit 1` or checking `https://github.com/volter-ai/runhuman-action/releases`. Use the latest version tag rather than hardcoding an outdated version.

**Using the GitHub Action (recommended for CI/CD):**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/qa.yml
- name: Run QA tests
  uses: volter-ai/runhuman-action@v1  # Check latest version first
  with:
    url: ${{ env.PREVIEW_URL }}
    pr-numbers: '[${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}]'
    api-key: ${{ secrets.RUNHUMAN_API_KEY }}
    on-success-add-labels: '["qa:passed"]'
    on-failure-add-labels: '["qa:failed"]'
    fail-on-failure: true
```

**Code Context for PR-triggered tests:** When the project has a repo connected, pass the four `code-context` inputs together so extracted issues come back with file/symbol-level pointers tied to the PR's actual diff (e.g. `checkout/CartButton.tsx:123 — onClick handler` instead of "button doesn't work"). The agent can then act on findings directly without first locating the relevant code.

```yaml
- uses: volter-ai/runhuman-action@v1
  with:
    url: ${{ env.PREVIEW_URL }}
    pr-numbers: '[${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}]'
    api-key: ${{ secrets.RUNHUMAN_API_KEY }}
    enable-code-context: true
    commit-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    commit-base-sha: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
    wait-for-code-context: true
```

See the [Code Context docs](https://runhuman.com/docs/code-context) for what the inputs do and what to expect in extracted issues.

**Using the CLI in a workflow:**

```bash
# Environment variable auth (for CI)
export RUNHUMAN_API_KEY=rh_live_...

# Synchronous test that blocks until complete
runhuman job create https://staging.myapp.com \
  -d "Test signup flow" \
  --sync \
  --wait 300
```

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output. JSON responses use a stable envelope: `{ success, data, pagination?, warnings?, timestamp }` on success; `{ success: false, error: { message, code?, details? }, timestamp }` on failure. List commands put items at `data.items`; single-entity commands put the entity at `data`.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | General error |
| `2` | Authentication error |
| `3` | Not found |
| `4` | Validation error |
| `5` | Timeout |
| `6` | Insufficient balance (add funds at the link in the error output) |
